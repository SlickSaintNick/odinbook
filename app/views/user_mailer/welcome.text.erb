We're so happy that you've joined OdinBook!

I wrote this app as a task in the "Ruby on Rails" course for The Odin Project.

To get started with OdinBook, click the 'Create your Profile' link on your Home page to create your profile. You can set up your Bio, and upload a profile image.

Visit the User Index page: <%= profiles_url %> to follow other members. Once they accept your follow request, you can see and comment on their posts and their profile. They can also request to follow you back.

Happy OdinBooking!
